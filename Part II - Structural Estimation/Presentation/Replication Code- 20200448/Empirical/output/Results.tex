The total size of the deposit market is defined as the sum of deposits, cash, and Treasury bills held by all U.S.\  households and non-financial corporations. The total size of the loan market is defined as the sum of U.S.\ corporate and household debt. Deposit and loan rates are calculated using interest expense and income. Expense related to fixed assets and salaries are scaled by total assets. Deposit shares, loan shares, deposit rates, loan rates, expenses related to fixed assets, salaries, and net noninterest expenses are reported in percentages. Asset maturity is reported in years. ``(vw)'' indicates an asset-weighted mean, and ``(ew)'' indicates an equal-weighted mean .  The data sources are the  Call Reports and the FDIC Summary of Deposits. \\}

Log No. of Employees ($\beta_1$) refers to the sensitivity of depositors (borrowers) to the log number of employees per branch. Yield sensitivity ($\sigma_\alpha$) refers to the dispersion in the sensitivity of depositors to deposit rates, with the dispersion  set at 0 for firms.
