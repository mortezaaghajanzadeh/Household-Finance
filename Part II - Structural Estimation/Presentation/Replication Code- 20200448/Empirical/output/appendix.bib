	abstract = {This paper develops techniques for empirically
                   analyzing demand and supply in differentiated product
                   markets and then applies these techniques to the U.S.
                   automobile industry. The authors' framework enables
                   one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters
                   for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products
                   markets. These estimates can be obtained using only
                   widely available product-level and aggregate
                   consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a
                   structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic
                   industry. Applying these techniques, the authors
                   obtain parameters for essentially all autos sold over
                   a twenty-year period. Copyright 1995 by The

@article{Nevo2001,
	abstract = {The ready-to-eat cereal industry is characterized by
                   high concentration, high price-cost margins, large
                   advertising-to-sales ratios, and numerous
                   introductions of new products. Previous researchers
                   have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry
                   is a classic example of an industry with nearly
                   collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice
                   competition. This paper empirically examines this
                   conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost
                   margins, but more importantly I am able empirically
                   to separate these margins into three sources: (i)
                   that which is due to product differentiation; (ii)
                   that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and
                   (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The
                   results suggest that given the demand for different
                   brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most
                   of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that
                   prices in the industry are consistent with
                   noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high
                   price-cost margins. Leading firms are able to
                   maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and
                   influence the perceived product quality. It is these
                   two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},
