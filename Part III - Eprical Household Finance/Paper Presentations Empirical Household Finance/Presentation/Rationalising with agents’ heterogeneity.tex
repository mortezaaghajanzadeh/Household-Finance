\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> \textbf{Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) occurs with an increase in disposable income:
			\begin{equation*}
				MPC = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}
			\end{equation*}
		\end{itemize}
		\item<2-> We overviewed the Measurement of the MPC.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> Off-the-shelf models of consumption predict that the MPC should be negligible in the aggregate. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \cite{heathcote2009quantitative} provide a good survey of these models.
		\end{itemize}
		\item<2-> However, the empirical literature has found that the MPC is large and varies substantially across households.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Collective evidence suggests that the MPC is around \textbf{0.25}.
			\item Higher MPC for lower wealth or liquidity households.
			\item Let's call this characteristic of the households \textbf{Hand-to-Mouth (H2M)}.
		\end{itemize}
		\item<3-> \textbf{Question}: How can we rationalize the H2M behavior?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Heterogeneous Assets}
\begin{frame}{\cite{kaplan2014model}}
\begin{itemize}
		\item They classify assets into two categories:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Liquid Assets}: such as cash and bank accounts.
			\item \textbf{Illiquid Assets}: such as housing and retirement wealth.
		\end{itemize}
		\item<2-> The trade-off between these two assets is that illiquid assets have higher returns but have higher transaction costs.
		\item<3->  HH can only borrow against liquid assets with a ad-hoc borrowing limit.
		\item<4->[] They calibrate the model to match the empirical targets
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Results}{Calibration Results \citep{kaplan2014model}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The model features two types of households:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<2-> \textbf{Poor Hand-to-Mouth}: HHs with zero net worth which are constrained by the borrowing limit. 
			\item<3-> \textbf{Wealthy Hand-to-Mouth}: HHs with positive net worth but with a large share of their wealth in illiquid assets. They are around 1/3 of the population.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item<4-> They are constrained by the transaction costs of illiquid assets.
				\item<4-> They are better off bearing the welfare loss rather than smoothing their consumption. They have to pay the transaction costs to convert their illiquid assets to liquid assets.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		\item<4-> The wealthy H2M drives high values of the aggregate MPC which in the one-asset models this group is not constrained due to their high net worth.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Results}{Experiments \citep{kaplan2014model}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> Macroeconomic conditions affect the MPC:
		\begin{itemize}
			\footnotesize
			\item<1-> In mild recessions, wealthy H2M households may avoid accessing illiquid assets, leading to amplified liquidity constraints and a strong consumption response to fiscal stimulus.

			\item<1-> In severe recessions, more households tap into illiquid assets, resulting in fewer H2M households upon receiving the rebate and a reduced impact on consumption compared to milder downturns.
		\end{itemize}
		\item<2-> Comparing the budget equivalent of the stimulus payments, the model predicts that the strongest response occurs when the payment is close to the median income.
		\item <3-> The model predicts that the calculated MPC depends on the information structure.
		\begin{itemize}
			\footnotesize
			\item<3-> MPC is 11\% when the HHs are fully informed about the stimulus payment.
			\item <3-> MPC is 25\% when the HHs are only informed about the payment after receiving it.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

\section{Heterogeneous Preferences/Expectations}
\begin{frame}{\cite{carroll2017distribution}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> They try to model the distribution of \textbf{wealth} (answer the inequality question) and \textbf{MPC} (high estimated value of MPC).
		\item <2-> They solve a model with HH-specific income process including permanent and transitory shocks.
		\item <3-> They also allow for HH to have different preferences (like impatience, proxying for many characteristics including age, optimism, and risk aversion) or equivalently different beliefs about the future.
		\item<4->[] They calibrate the model to match the empirical targets
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Results}{\citep{carroll2017distribution}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item <1-> They find that quite modest heterogeneity in preferences is sufficient to match the empirical distribution of wealth.
		\item <2-> They find that the estimated MPC is around 0.2.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item <2-> Many consumers in the model hold little wealth and have a strong precautionary motive.
		\end{itemize}
		\item <3-> The aggregate MPC can differ greatly depending on the distribution of shocks across households.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item <3-> e.g. low-wealth and unemployed HHs have a high MPC.
		\end{itemize}
		\item <4-> The model predicts that the distribution of MPC do not change much over different business cycles.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Heterogeneous Beliefs with Heterogeneous Assets}
\begin{frame}{\cite{aguiar2023hand}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> They use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to document new facts about the H2M behavior.
		\item<2-> They can use the panel structure of the data to capture the long-run heterogeneity in the HHs.
		\item <3-> Motivated by the empirical facts, they calibrate \cite{kaplan2014model} to capture the extent of preferences heterogeneity. 
	\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item <1-> The observed MPC is high and heterogeneous across households.
		\item <2-> The H2M behavior is a key driver of the high and heterogeneous MPC.
		\item <3-> The H2M differs from the liquidity constrained HHs in the sense that they have the ability to smooth their consumption but they choose not to.
		\item <4-> The H2M behavior is driven by the preference heterogeneity.
